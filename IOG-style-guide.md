# IOG Technical Writing Guidelines

The IOG technical writing guidelines are derived from the IOG style guide and previous working documents. We encourage technical writers to apply these guidelines consistently across all documentation and product websites. This commitment ensures a unified and polished presentation across all IOG products.

Note that these are general guidelines; for more details on how to write product names, phases, and cryptocurrency-related terms, see the IOG style guide.

## General Notes

### Clarity and Simplicity
Ensure simplicity, accuracy, and accessibility. Aim for a broad understanding, even for select audiences.

### Conciseness
Readers are busy; avoid unnecessary words. Prioritize the mainstream adoption of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and ada.

## Style Principles

### Language
- Use American English: -ize rather than -ise endings, ‘color’ instead of ‘colour’.
- Avoid slang words.
- Use gender-inclusive pronouns – they/their/them.
- Use active voice; avoid passive voice.

### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- No full stops in abbreviations: eg, ie, PhD, etc, v (note, not vs), plc, Inc.
- Write acronyms as said; use initial caps for entities; avoid capitalization.
- Minimize the use of acronyms and initialisms. Spell out on first use, eg peer-to-peer (P2P), and try to avoid where possible.
- Write acronyms the way they are said: radar, laser, captcha. Use initial cap for entities, eg NASA, and new terms, eg Snark, until they become accepted, such as captcha. The standard IOG dictionary is the Cambridge dictionary.

### Legal and Investment
- Avoid investment or legal advice.

### Punctuation
- Use the Oxford/serial comma.
- Use single quote marks: ‘cascading disruption’.
- Use en dash – (option-hyphen on a Mac keyboard; Alt-hyphen on PC).

### Capitalization
- Lower case for job titles, degree names, and university departments.
- Use lower case after a colon, eg ‘Feature: this feature is about…’.
- Book, film, and game titles in italics; academic papers in ‘single quotes’ – avoid subtitles.

### Numbers and Time
- Spell out one to nine: one, two, three, four, five, once I caught a fish alive.
- Except for percentages: 1%, 2%, 3%.
- Use numerals for anything higher: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
- Spell out million, billion when in prose: there are nine million bicycles in Beijing.
- Use abbreviations for money: £5m, $10bn, 12tn yen.
- When talking generally, use MMMM DD, YYYY format, eg February 1, 2018.
- For technical purposes, IOHK adopted the ISO 8601 standard for dates and time in March 2020: YYYY-MM-DD, eg 2018-02-01.

### Bullet Lists
- Start with a capital letter and use full stops in complete sentences. You can format the bullet ‘title’ in bold if there is one:
  - **Feature name 1.** This full sentence describes the feature in more detail.
  - **Feature name 2.** This full sentence describes the second feature in more detail.
- Omit full stops in short itemized lists. For example, the discussed feature includes such items as:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3.
- In shorter statements, full stops can also be omitted. For example:
  - Maintain uniformity across all documentation
  - Encourage user interaction with clear instructions
  - Incorporate visuals judiciously to enhance understanding.

### Links
Write clear and meaningful links; don’t use ‘here’ as a link. Always embed links; don’t just paste one as is.

### Headlines and Titles

#### General Notes
- No full stops at the end of headlines, pull quotes, captions, and other display matter, or when referencing figures: just ‘See Figure 1 for details…’.
- Headlines are ‘Sentence case only’. The use of capitals is a way of avoiding confusion for proper names. Use initial caps for navigation section names and topic headings.

#### Main Navigation Section Headings
Use short verbs for section headings. These should be action verbs where possible and rounded and engaging.

- Learn
- Explore
- Build
- Develop
- Maintain

#### Subheadings (subtopics that are part of the main navigation section)
Use gerunds for task-based headings.

See structure notes for details about headings and subtopics below.

- Getting started
- Installing Glow
- Integrating with Rosetta
- Using the Haskell editor

## Documentation Structure

There are different types of documentation entries published on the websites. These include but are not limited to explainers, tutorials, how-to guides, release notes, and developer guidelines.

### General Notes
- Maintain uniformity across all documentation.
- Encourage user interaction with clear instructions.
- Incorporate visuals judiciously to enhance understanding.

### Proposed Structure for Common Documents on IOG Docs Sites

#### Explainers
- **Title** (level 1 heading), usually rendered automatically after creating a file in GitHub
- **Short description** (body) – a paragraph summarizing what this document is about
- **Subtopic 1** (level 2 heading)
- **Subtopic 2** (level 2 heading)
- ...
- **Subtopic n** (level 2 heading)
- **Conclusion (optional)** (level 2 heading).

Level 2 headings can include level 3 subheadings. Don’t use level 4 subheadings; prefer bold formatting if necessary.
