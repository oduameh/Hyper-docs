# Webhooks {#webhooks}

## Overview

Webhooks enable real-time event notifications from the Cloud agent to your application. Instead of polling for status changes, your application receives HTTP callbacks whenever connections are established, credentials are issued, or proofs are verified. This section explains webhook configuration, event types, and implementation patterns for processing notifications.

---

## Introduction

This tutorial explores how webhook notifications enhance your experience with the Cloud agent by providing real-time updates on events. By leveraging webhook notifications, you stay informed about important changes happening within the agent.

## Understanding webhook notifications

### What are webhooks?

Webhooks enable real-time communication between applications by sending HTTP requests containing event data to specified endpoints (webhook URLs) when events occur. They establish a direct communication channel, allowing applications to receive instant updates and respond in a timely manner, which promotes efficient integration between event-driven systems.

### Purpose of webhook notifications in the Cloud agent

Webhook notifications in the Cloud agent serve as a vital feature, enabling you to receive timely updates on various events occurring within the agent. Webhooks allow you to receive HTTP requests containing event details at a specified endpoint (webhook URL). These events are specifically related to the execution of the [Connect](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/tutorials/connections/connection), [Issue](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/tutorials/credentials/didcomm/issue), and [Presentation](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/tutorials/credentials/didcomm/present-proof) flows. Webhook notifications are sent each time there is a state change during the execution of these protocols.

By leveraging webhooks, you can integrate the Cloud agent seamlessly into your applications and systems. You can track and monitor the progress of the main flows, receiving timely updates about changes and events.

## Configuring the webhook feature

### Enabling the webhook feature

There are two types of webhook notifications: global webhooks and wallet webhooks. Global webhooks capture all events that happen on the Cloud agent across all wallets, whereas wallet webhooks only capture events that are specific to assets within a particular wallet.

**Enable global webhook using environment variables**

The Cloud agent uses the following environment variables to manage global webhook notifications:

| Name | Description | Default |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `GLOBAL_WEBHOOK_URL` | The webhook endpoint URL where the notifications will be sent | null |
| `GLOBAL_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` | The optional API key (bearer token) to use as the `Authorization` header | null |

**Enable wallet webhook for default wallet using environment variables**

In a multi-tenant scenario, the Cloud agent can optionally create a default wallet to simplify the development and deployment process. The webhook configuration for this default wallet can be defined using environment variables. After the default wallet is created, its webhook settings are stored in the system and are no longer influenced by these environment variables.

| Name | Description | Default |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `DEFAULT_WALLET_ENABLED` | Automatically create default on the Cloud agent startup | true |
| `DEFAULT_WALLET_WEBHOOK_URL` | The webhook endpoint URL where the notifications will be sent | null |
| `DEFAULT_WALLET_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` | The optional API key (bearer token) to use as the `Authorization` header | null |

**Enable wallet hook using REST API**

In a multi-tenant scenario, there is an option to configure wallet webhook parameters using a REST API, which offers more flexibility. For each individual wallet, users can create a new webhook by making a POST request to `/events/webhooks`, which in turn creates a new webhook resource specific to their wallet.

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/events/webhooks' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header "apiKey: $API_KEY" \
  --data-raw '{
    "url": "http://localhost:9095"
  }'
```

Response Example:

```json
{
    "id": "e9569dd0-bffa-4be4-94fe-f5025a79029a",
    "url": "http://localhost:9095",
    "customHeaders": {},
    "createdAt": "2023-09-12T08:39:03.871339Z"
}
```

### Securing the webhook endpoint

It is essential to secure the webhook endpoint to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the event data. Consider the following best practices when securing your webhook endpoint:

- Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the Cloud agent and the webhook endpoint.  
- Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, tokens) to verify the authenticity of incoming requests.  
- Validate and sanitize incoming webhook requests to mitigate potential security risks.

One of the authorization mechanism for the Cloud agent's webhook notifications is the bearer token. If configured, the token will be included in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request sent by the agent to the webhook endpoint. You can configure this bearer token by setting the value of the `GLOBAL_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` or `DEFAULT_WALLET_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` environment variable.

An alternative approach is to make use of the `customHeaders` property within the REST API for configuring webhooks. This option offers increased flexibility when custom or multiple headers are needed.

## Event format and types

### Event format

Webhook notifications from the Cloud agent are sent as JSON payloads in the HTTP requests.

The event format is consistent across all events. Each event follows a common structure, while the 'data' field within the event payload contains information specific to the type of event. Here is an example of the JSON payload format:

```json
{
  "id": "cb8d4e96-30f0-4892-863f-44d49d634211",
  "ts": "2023-07-06T12:01:19.769427Z",
  "type": "xxxx",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data goes here 
  },
  "walletId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

This event format ensures consistency and allows you to handle webhook notifications uniformly while easily extracting the relevant data specific to each event type from the `data` field.

Here is a complete example of a webhook notification event related to a connection flow state change (invitation generated):

```json
{
  "id": "cb8d4e96-30f0-4892-863f-44d49d634211",
  "ts": "2023-07-06T12:01:19.769427Z",
  "type": "ConnectionUpdated",
  "data": {
    "connectionId": "c10787cf-99bb-47f4-99bb-1fdcca32b673",
    "label": "Connect with Alice",
    "role": "Inviter",
    "state": "InvitationGenerated",
    "invitation": {
      "id": "c10787cf-99bb-47f4-99bb-1fdcca32b673",
      "type": "https://didcomm.org/out-of-band/2.0/invitation",
      "from": "did:peer:2.Ez6LS...jIiXX0",
      "invitationUrl": "https://my.domain.com/path?_oob=eyJpZCI6...bXX19"
    },
    "createdAt": "2023-07-06T12:01:19.760126Z",
    "self": "c10787cf-99bb-47f4-99bb-1fdcca32b673",
    "kind": "Connection"
  },
  "walletId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

### Common event types

The Cloud agent sends webhook notifications for events related to protocol state changes in the [Connect](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/tutorials/connections/connection), [Issue](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/tutorials/credentials/didcomm/issue), [Presentation](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/tutorials/credentials/didcomm/present-proof) flows, and also [DID publication](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/tutorials/dids/publish) state changes. These events allow you to track the progress and updates within these flows in real-time.

The `id` field of the common event structure is the unique identifier (UUID) of the event and is randomly generated at event creation time.

The `ts` field contains the timestamp (date \+ time) at which the event was created.

The `walletId` field contains information about the wallet from which the event originates.

The `type` field indicates to which flow/process the received event is related, and hence the type of JSON payload that can be expected in the inner `data` field. Possible values are:

| Value | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| `ConnectionUpdated` | An update in the connection flow state |
| `IssueCredentialRecordUpdated` | An update in the VC issuance flow state |
| `PresentationUpdated` | An update in the VC presentation flow state |
| `DIDStatusUpdated` | An update in the DID publication state |

State change notifications that you can expect to receive through webhook notifications include:

- Connection State Change: Notifies about state changes in the connection flow, such as `InvitationGenerated`, `ConnectionRequestSent`, `ConnectionResponseReceived`, etc. Please refer to the `state` field of the [connection resource](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/agent-api/#tag/Connections-Management/operation/getConnection) for an exhaustive list of states.  
- Credential State Change: Indicates changes in the credential issuance flow, such as `OfferSent`, `RequestReceived`, `CredentialSent`, etc. Please refer to the `protocolState` field of the [credential resource](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/getCredentialRecord) for an exhaustive list of states.  
- Presentation State Change: Notifies about changes in the presentation flow, such as `RequestReceived`, `PresentationGenerated`, `PresentationVerified`, etc. Please refer to the `status` field of the [presentation resource](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/agent-api/#tag/Present-Proof/operation/getPresentation) for an exhaustive list of states.  
- DID State Change: Notifies about DID-related state changes. Currently, only the `Published` DID publication state event will be notified.

## Processing webhook notifications

### Handling incoming webhook requests

To handle incoming webhook notifications from the Cloud agent in your application, follow these general steps:

1. Receive the HTTP request at your specified webhook endpoint.  
2. Parse the JSON payload of the request to extract the event details.  
3. Process the event data according to your application's requirements.  
4. Send a response back to acknowledge the successful receipt of the webhook notification. For a successful reception, the response status code should be `>= 200` and `< 300`. Any other response status code will lead to a new attempt from the Cloud agent.

### Error handling and retry mechanisms

When working with webhook notifications in the Cloud agent, it is important to consider error handling and retry mechanisms. In case of failed webhook notifications or errors, the Cloud agent employs an automatic retry mechanism to ensure delivery. The agent will attempt to send the webhook notification up to three times, with a five-second interval between each attempt. Please note that the number of retries and the interval duration are currently not configurable in the Cloud agent.

By default, this retry mechanism provides a reasonable level of reliability for delivering webhook notifications, allowing for temporary network issues or intermittent failures.

### A basic Webhook implementation for logging requests

In the following example, we will demonstrate a simple Python code snippet that sets up a webhook endpoint and logs incoming HTTP requests to the console. This basic implementation can serve as a starting point for building more advanced webhook systems.

In the provided Python code snippet, the port on which the webhook listener will listen for incoming requests should be passed as a command-line parameter. This allows flexibility in starting multiple webhooks in parallel, which is useful when testing multiple locally running agents, e.g. for a holder, an issuer, and/or a verifier.
